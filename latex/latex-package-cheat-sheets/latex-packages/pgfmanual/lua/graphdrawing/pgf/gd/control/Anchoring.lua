-- @section subsection {Anchoring a Graph}
--
-- \label{subsection-library-graphdrawing-anchoring}
--
-- A graph drawing algorithm must compute positions of the nodes of a
-- graph, but the computed positions are only \emph{relative} (``this
-- node is left of this node, but above that other node''). It is not
-- immediately obvious where the ``the whole graph'' should be placed
-- \emph{absolutely} once all relative positions have been computed. In
-- case that the graph consists of several unconnected components, the
-- situation is even more complicated.
-- 
-- The order in which the algorithm layer determines the node at which
-- the graph should be anchored:
--
-- \begin{enumerate}
-- \item If the |anchor node=|\meta{node name} option given to the graph
--   as a whole, the graph is anchored at \meta{node name}, provided
--   there is a node of this name in the graph. (If there is no node of
--   this name or if it is misspelled, the effect is the same as if this
--   option had not been given at all.)
-- \item Otherwise, if there is a node where the |anchor here| option is
--   specified, the first node with this option set is used.
-- \item Otherwise, if there is a node where the |desired at| option is
--   set (perhaps implicitly through keys like |x|), the first such node
--   is used.
-- \item Finally, in all other cases, the first node is used.
-- \end{enumerate}
--
-- In the above description, the ``first'' node refers to the node first
-- encountered in the specification of the graph.
--
-- Once the node has been determined, the graph is shifted so that
-- this node lies at the poistion specified by |anchor at|.
