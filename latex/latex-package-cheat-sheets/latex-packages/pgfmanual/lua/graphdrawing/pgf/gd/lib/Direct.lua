--- Compute a digraph from a syntactic digraph.
--
-- This function takes a syntactic digraph and compute a new digraph
-- where all arrow point in the "semantic direction" of the syntactic
-- arrows. For instance, while "a <- b" will cause an arc from a to be
-- to be added to the syntactic digraph, calling this function will
-- return a digraph in which there is an arc from b to a rather than
-- the other way round. In detail, "a <- b" is tranlated as just
-- described, "a -> b" yields an arc from a to b as expected, "a <-> b"
-- and "a -- b" yield arcs in both directions and, finally, "a -!- b"
-- yields no arc at all.
--
-- @param syntactic_digraph A syntacitic digraph, usually the "input"
-- graph as specified syntactically be the user.
--
-- @return A new "semantic" digraph object.
