-- @section subsection {Node Positioning (Coordinate Assignment)}
--
-- The second last step of the Sugiyama method decides about the final
-- $x$- and $y$-coordinates of the nodes. The main objectives of this
-- step are to position nodes so that the number of edge bends is kept
-- small and edges are drawn as vertically as possible. Another goal
-- is to avoid node and edge overlaps which is crucial in particular
-- if the nodes are allowed to have non-uniform sizes. The
-- y-coordinates of the nodes have no influence on the number of
-- bends. Obviously, nodes need to be separated enough geometrically
-- so that they do not overlap. It feels natural to aim at separating
-- all layers in the drawing by the same amount. Large nodes, however,
-- may force node positioning algorithms to override this uniform
-- level distance in order to avoid overlaps. 
--
-- For more details, please see Section 4.1.2 of Pohlmann's Diploma
-- thesis.
