-- @section subsection {Layer Assignment (Node Ranking)}
--
-- Algorithms for producing layered drawings place nodes on discrete
-- layers from top to bottom. Layer assignment is the problem of
-- finding a partition so that for all edges $e = (u,v) \in E(G)$ the 
-- equation $\mathit{layer}(u) < \mathit{layer}(v)$ holds. Such a
-- partition is called a \emph{layering}. This definition can be extended by
-- introducing edge weights or priorities and minimum length
-- constraints which has practical applications and allows users to
-- fine-tune the results.
--
-- For more details, please see Section 4.1.2 of Pohlmann's Diploma
-- thesis.
