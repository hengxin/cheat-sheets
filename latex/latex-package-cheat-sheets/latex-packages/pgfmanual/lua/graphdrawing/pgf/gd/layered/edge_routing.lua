-- @section subsection {Edge Routing}
--
-- The original layered drawing method described by Eades and Sugiyama
-- in does not include the routing or shaping of edges as a main
-- step. This makes sense if all nodes have the same size and
-- shape. In practical scenarios, however, this assumption often does
-- not hold. In these cases, advanced techniques may have to be
-- applied in order to avoid overlaps of nodes and edges. 
--
-- For more details, please see Section 4.1.5 of Pohlmann's Diploma
-- thesis.
