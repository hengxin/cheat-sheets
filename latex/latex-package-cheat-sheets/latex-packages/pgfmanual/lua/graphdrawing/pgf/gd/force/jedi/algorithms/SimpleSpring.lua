  [[The simple spring algorithm only uses one force kind: A spring force 
  that serves as both attracitve and repuslive force. The edges are modeled as 
  springs and act according to Hoke's law: They have an ideal length and will 
  expand if they are contracted below this length, pushing the adjacent 
  vertices away from each other, and contract if it is stretched, pulling the 
  adjacent vertices towards each other. This ideal length is given by the 
  parameter |node distance|. There is no force repelling vertices that are not 
  connected to each other, which can lead to vertices being placed at the same 
  point. It is not a very powerfull layout and will probably fail with large 
  graphs, especially if they have few edges. It can however be used to 
  demonstrate the effect of spring forces. This layout was implemented by using
   the Jedi framework.
