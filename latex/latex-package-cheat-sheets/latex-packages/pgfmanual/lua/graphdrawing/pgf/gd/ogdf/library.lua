-- The Open Graph Drawing Framework (\textsc{ogdf}) is a large,
-- powerful graph drawing system written in C++. This library enables
-- its use inside \tikzname's graph drawing system by translating
-- back-and-forth between Lua and C++.
--
-- Since C++ code is compiled and not interpreted (like Lua), in order
-- to use the present library, you need a compiled version of the
-- \pgfname\ interface code for the \textsc{ogdf} library
-- (|pgf/gd/ogdf/c/ogdf_script.so|) installed correctly for your particular
-- architecture. This is by no means trivial\dots
--
-- @library

local ogdf


-- Load the C++ code:

require "pgf_gd_ogdf_c_ogdf_script"
