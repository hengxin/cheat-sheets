-- A |Vertex| instance models a node of graphs. Each |Vertex| object can be an 
-- element of any number of graphs (whereas an |Arc| object can only be an
-- element of a single graph). 
-- 
-- When a vertex is added to a digraph |g|, two tables are created in
-- the vertex' storage: An array of incoming arcs (with respect to
-- |g|) and an array of outgoing arcs (again, with respect to
-- |g|). The fields are managed by the |Digraph| class and should not
-- be modified directly.
--
-- Note that a |Vertex| is an abstraction of \tikzname\ nodes; indeed
-- that objective is to ensure that, in principle, we can use them
-- independently of \TeX. For this reason, you will not find any
-- references to |tex| inside a |Vertex|; this information is only
-- available in the syntactic digraph.
--
-- One important aspect of vertices are its anchors -- a concept well
-- familiar for users of \tikzname, but since we need to abstract from
-- \tikzname, a separate anchor management is available inside the
-- graph drawing system. It works as follows:
--
-- First of all, every vertex has a path, which is a (typically
-- closed) line around the vertex. The display system will pass down
-- the vertex' path to the graph drawing system and this path will be
-- stored as a |Path| object in the |path| field of the vertex. This
-- path lives in a special ``local'' coordinate system, that is, all
-- coordinates of this path should actually be considered relative to
-- the vertex' |pos| field. Note that the path is typically, but not
-- alwyas, ``centered'' on the origin. A graph drawing algorithm
-- should arrange the vertices in such a way that the origins in the
-- path coordinate systems are aligned.
--
-- To illustrate the difference between the origin and the vertex
-- center, conside a tree drawing algorithm in which a node |root| has
-- three children |a|, |b|, and |g|. Now, if we were to simply center
-- these three letters vertically and arrange them in a line, the
-- letters would appear to ``jump up and down'' since the height of
-- the three letters are quite different. A solution is to shift the
-- letters (and, thus, the paths of the vertices) in such a way that
-- in all three letters the baseline of the letters is exactly at the
-- origin. Now, when a graph drawing algorithm aligns these vertices
-- along the origins, the letters will all have the same baseline. 
--
-- Apart from the origin, there may be other positions in the path
-- coordinate system that are of interest -- such as the center of
-- the vertex. As mentioned above, this need not be the origin and
-- although a graph drawing algorithm should align the origins,
-- \emph{edges} between vertices should head toward these vertex
-- centers rather that toward the origins. Other points of interest
-- might be the ``top'' of the node. 
--
-- All points of special interest are called ``anchors''. The |anchor|
-- method allows you to retrieve them. By default, you always have
-- access to the |center| anchor, but other anchors may or may not be
-- available also, see the |anchor| method for details.
--
-- @field pos A coordinate object that stores the position where the
-- vertex should be placed on the canvas. The main objective of graph drawing
-- algorithms is to update this coordinate.
--
-- @field name An optional string that is used as a textual representation
--        of the node.
--
-- @field path The path of the vertex's shape. This is a path along
-- the outer line resulting from stroking the vertex's original
-- shape. For instance, if you have a quadratic shape of size 1cm and
-- you stroke the path with a pen of 2mm thickness, this |path| field
-- would store a path of a square of edge length 12mm. 
--
-- @field anchors A table of anchors (in the TikZ sense). The table is
-- indexed by the anchor names (strings) and the values are
-- |Coordinate|s. Currently, it is only guaranteed that the |center|
-- anchor is present. Note that the |center| anchor need not lie at
-- the origin: A graph drawing system should align nodes relative to
-- the origin of the path's coordinate system. However, lines going to
-- and from the node will head towards the |center| anchor. See
-- Section~\ref{section-gd-anchors} for details.
--
-- @field options A table of options that contains user-defined options.
--
-- @field shape A string describing the shape of the node (like |rectangle|
-- or |circle|). Note, however, that this is more ``informative''; the
-- actual information that is used by the graph drawing system for
-- determining the extent of a node, its bounding box, convex hull,
-- and line intersections is the |path| field. 
--
-- @field kind A string describing the kind of the node. For instance, a
--        node of type |"dummy"| does not correspond to any real node in
--        the graph but is used by the graph drawing algorithm.
--
-- @field event The |Event| when this vertex was created (may be |nil|
-- if the vertex is not part of the syntactic digraph).

-- Returns an anchor position in a vertex. First, we try to look

-- the given direction (so |south east| would be the lower right
-- corner). We intersect this line with the vertex's path and return

-- at the vertex's center with the number as its angle and the path of
