-- Each |Digraph| instance models a \emph{directed, simple}
-- graph. ``Directed'' means that all edges ``point'' from a head node
-- to a tail node. ``Simple'' means that between any nodes there can be
-- (at most) one edge. Since these properties are a bit at odds with
-- the normal behaviour of ``nodes'' and ``edges'' in \tikzname,
-- different names are used for them inside the |model| namespace:
-- The class modeling  ``edges'' is actually called |Arc| to stress
-- that an arc has a specific ``start'' (the tail) and a specific
-- ``end'' (the head). The class modeling ``nodes'' is actually called
-- |Vertex|, just to stress that this is not a direct model of a
-- \tikzname\ |node|, but can represent a arbitrary vertex of a graph,
-- independently of whether it is an actual |node| in \tikzname.
--
-- \medskip
-- \noindent\emph{Time Bounds.}
-- Since digraphs are constantly created and modified inside the graph
-- drawing engine, some care was taken to ensure that all operations
-- work as quickly as possible. In particular:
-- \begin{itemize}
-- \item Adding an array of $k$ vertices using the |add| method needs
--   time $O(k)$.
-- \item Adding an arc between two vertices needs time $O(1)$.
-- \item Accessing both the |vertices| and the |arcs| fields takes time
--   $O(1)$, provided only the above operations are used.
-- \end{itemize}
-- Deleting vertices and arcs takes more time:
-- \begin{itemize}
-- \item Deleting the vertices given in an array of $k$ vertices from a
--   graph with $n$ vertices takes time $O(\max\{n,c\})$ where $c$ is the
--   number of arcs between the to-be-deleted nodes and the remaining
--   nodes. Note that this time bound in independent of~$k$. In
--   particular, it will be much faster to delete many vertices by once
--   calling the |remove| function instead of calling it repeatedly.
-- \item Deleting an arc takes time $O(t_o+h_i)$ where $t_o$ is the
--   number of outgoing arcs at the arc's tail and $h_i$ is the number
--   of incoming arcs at the arc's head. After a call to |disconnect|,
--   the next use of the |arcs| field will take time $O(|V| + |E|)$,
--   while subsequent accesses take time $O(1)$ -- till the  
--   next use of |disconnect|. This means that once you start deleting
--   arcs using |disconnect|, you should perform as many additional
--   |disconnect|s as possible before accessing |arcs| one more.
-- \end{itemize}
--  
-- \medskip
-- \noindent\emph{Stability.} The |vertices| field and the array
-- returned by |Digraph:incoming| and |Digraph:outgoing| are
-- \emph{stable} in the following sense: The ordering of the elements
-- when you use |ipairs| on the will be the ordering in which the
-- vertices or arcs were added to the graph. Even when you remove a
-- vertex or an arc, the ordering of the remaining elements stays the
-- same. 
--
-- @field vertices This array contains the vertices that are part of
-- the digraph. Internally, this array
-- is an object of type |LookupTable|, but you can mostly treat it as
-- if it were an array. In particular, you can iterate over its
-- elements using |ipairs|, but you may not modify the array; use the
-- |add| and |remove| methods, instead.
--
-- \begin{codeexample}[code only, tikz syntax=false]
-- local g = Digraph.new {}
--
-- g:add { v1, v2 } -- Add vertices v1 and v2
-- g:remove { v2 }  -- Get rid of v2.
--
-- assert (g:contains(v1))
-- assert (not g:contains(v2))
-- \end{codeexample}
--
-- It is important to note that although each digraph stores a
-- |vertices| array, the elements in this array are not exclusive to
-- the digraph: A vertex can be an element of any number of
-- digraphs. Whether or not a vertex is an element of digraph is not
-- stored in the vertex, only in the |vertices| array of the
-- digraph. To test whether a digraph contains a specific node, use the
-- |contains| method, which takes time $O(1)$ to perform the test (this
-- is because, as mentioned earlier, the |vertices| array is actually a
-- |LookupTable| and for each vertex |v| the field |vertices[v]| will
-- be true if, and only if, |v| is an element of the |vertices| array).
--
-- Do not use |pairs(g.vertices)| because this may cause your graph
-- drawing algorithm to produce different outputs on different runs.
--
-- A slightly annoying effect of vertices being able to belong to
-- several graphs at the same time is that the set of arcs incident to
-- a vertex is not a property of the vertex, but rather of the
-- graph. In other words, to get a list of all arcs whose tail is a
-- given vertex |v|, you cannot say something like |v.outgoings| or
-- perhaps |v:getOutgoings()|. Rather, you have to say |g:outgoing(v)|
-- to get this list:
--\begin{codeexample}[code only, tikz syntax=false]
--for _,a in ipairs(g:outgoing(v)) do  -- g is a Digraph object.    
--  pgf.debug ("There is an arc leaving " .. tostring(v) ..
--             " heading to " .. tostring(a.head))
--end
--\end{codeexample}
--   Naturally, there is also a method |g:incoming()|.
--  
--   To iterate over all arcs of a graph you can say:
--\begin{codeexample}[code only, tikz syntax=false]
--for _,v in ipairs(g.vertices) do
--  for _,a in ipairs(g:outgoing(v)) do
--   ...
--  end
--end
--\end{codeexample}
--
-- However, it will often be more convenient and, in case the there
-- are far less arcs than vertices, also faster to write
-- 
--\begin{codeexample}[code only, tikz syntax=false]
--for _,a in ipairs(g.arcs) do
--  ...
--end
--\end{codeexample}
--
-- @field arcs For any two vertices |t| and |h| of a graph, there may
--   or may not be 
--   an arc from |t| to |h|. If this is the case, there is an |Arc|
--   object that represents this arc. Note that, since |Digraph|s are
--   always simple graphs, there can be at most one such object for every
--   pair of vertices. However, you can store any information you like for
--   an |Arc| through a |Storage|, see the |Storage| class for
--   details. Each |Arc| for an edge of the syntactic digraph stores
--   an array called |syntactic_edges| of all the multiple edges that
--   are present in the user's input. 
--
--   Unlike vertices, the arc objects of a graph are always local to a
--   graph; an |Arc| object can never be part of two digraphs at the same
--   time. For this reason, while for vertices it makes sense to create
--   |Vertex| objects independently of any |Digraph| objects, it is not
--   possible to instantiate an |Arc| directly: only the |Digraph| method
--   |connect| is allowed to create new |Arc| objects and it will return
--   any existing arcs instead of creating new ones, if there is already
--   an arc present between two nodes.
--
--   The |arcs| field of a digraph contains a |LookupTable| of all arc
--   objects present in the |Digraph|. Although you can access this field
--   normally and use it in |ipairs| to iterate over all arcs of a graph,
--   note that this array is actually ``reconstructed lazily'' whenever
--   an arc is deleted from the graph. What happens is the following: As
--   long as you just add arcs to a graph, the |arcs| array gets updated
--   normally. However, when you remove an arc from a graph, the arc does
--   not get removed from the |arcs| array (which would be an expensive
--   operation). Instead, the |arcs| array is invalidated (internally set
--   to |nil|), allowing us to perform a |disconnect| in time
--   $O(1)$. The |arcs| array is then ignored until the next time it is
--   accessed, for instance when a user says |ipairs(g.arcs)|. At this
--   point, the |arcs| array is reconstructed by adding all arcs of all
--   nodes to it.
--
--   The bottom line of the behaviour of the |arcs| field is that (a) the
--   ordering of the elements may change abruptly whenever you remove an
--   arc from a graph and (b) performing $k$ |disconnect| operations in
--   sequence takes time $O(k)$, provided you do not access the |arcs|
--   field between calls.
--
-- @field syntactic_digraph is a reference to the syntactic digraph
--    from which this graph stems ultimately. This may be a cyclic
--    reference to the graph itself.
-- @field options If present, it will be a table storing
-- the options set for the syntactic digraph.

-- Collapse a set of vertices into a single vertex

-- Often, algorithms will wish to treat a whole set of vertices ``as a

-- into the graph, and this vertex is connected to all vertices to
-- which any of the original vertices used to be connected.
--
-- The |collapse| method takes an array of to-be-collapsed vertices as
-- well as a vertex. First, it will store references to the

-- all arcs of the to-be-collapsed vertices. If this arc connects a
-- to-be-collapsed vertex with a not-to-be-collapsed vertex, the
-- not-to-be-collapsed vertex is connected to the collapse
-- vertex. Additionally, the arc is stored at the vertex.
--
-- Note that the collapse vertex will be added to the graph if it is
