-- A collection is essentially a subgraph of a graph, that is, a
-- ``collection'' of some nodes and some edges of the graph. The name
-- ``collection'' was chosen over ``subgraph'' since the latter are
-- often thought of as parts of a graph that are rendered in a special
-- way (such as being surrounded by a rectangle), while collections
-- are used to model such diverse things as hyperedges, sets of
-- vertices that should be on the same level in a layered algorithm,
-- or, indeed, subgraphs that are rendered in a special way.
--
-- Collections are grouped into ``kinds.'' All collections of a given
-- kind can be accessed by algorithms through an array whose elements
-- are the collections. On the displya layer, for each kind a separate
-- key is available  to indicate that a node or an edge belongs to a
-- collection.  
--
-- Collections serve two purposes: First, they can be seen as ``hints''
-- to graph drawing algorithms that certain nodes and/or edges ``belong
-- together''. For instance, collections of kind |same layer| are used
-- by the Sugiyama algorithm to group together nodes that should appear
-- at the same height of the output. Second, since collections are also
-- passed back to the display layer in a postprocessing step, they can be
-- used to render complicated concepts such as hyperedges (which are
-- just collections of nodes, after all) or subgraphs.
--
-- @field kind The ``kind'' of the collection.
--
-- @field vertices A lookup table of vertices (that is, both an array
-- with the vertices in the order in which they appear as well as a
-- table such that |vertices[vertex] == true| whenever |vertex| is
-- present in the table.
--
-- @field edges A lookup table of edges (not arcs!).
--
-- @field options An options table. This is the table of options that
-- was in force when the collection was created.
--
-- @field child_collections An array of all collections that are
-- direct children of this collection (that is, 
-- they were defined while the current collection was the most
-- recently defined collection on the options stack). However, you
-- should use the methods |children|, |descendants|, and so to access
-- this field.
--
-- @field parent_collection The parent collection of the current
-- colleciton. This field may be |nil| in case a collection has no parent.
--
-- @field event An |Event| object that was create for this
-- collection. Its |kind| will be |"collection"| while its |parameter|
-- will be the collection kind.
