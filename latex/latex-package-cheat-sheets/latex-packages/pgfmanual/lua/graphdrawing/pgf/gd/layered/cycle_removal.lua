       When graphs are created by humans manually, one can 
       make assumptions about the input graph that would otherwise not
       be possible. For instance, it seems reasonable to assume that the
       order in which nodes and edges are entered by the user somehow
       reflects the natural flow the user has had in mind for the graph.

       In order to preserve the natural flow of the input graph, Gansner
       et al.\ propose to remove cycles by performing a series of
       depth-first searches starting at individual nodes in the order they
       appear in the graph. This algorithm
       implicitly constructs a spanning tree of the nodes reached during
       the searches. It thereby partitions the edges of the graph into
       tree edges and non-tree edges. The non-tree edges are further
       subdivided into forward edges, cross edges, and back edges. Forward
       edges point from a tree nodes to one of their descendants. Cross
       edges connect unrelated branches in 
       the search tree. Back edges connect descendants to one of their
       ancestors. It is not hard to see that reversing back edges will not
       only introduce no new cycles but will also make any directed graph
       acyclic. Gansner et al.\ argue that this approach is more stable
       than others in that fewer inappropriate edges are reversed compared
       to other methods, despite the lack of a provable upper bound
       for the number of reversed edges.
      
       See section 4.1.1 of Pohlmann's Diplom thesis for more details.
      
       This is the default algorithm for cycle removals.
