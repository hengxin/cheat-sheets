  [[The spring electric algorithm by Hu uses two kinds of forces and coarsening. 
  It is described in:

    \item 
    Yifan Hu,
    \newblock Efficient, high quality force-directed graph drawing,
    \newblock \emph{The Mathematica Journal,}
    10(1), 37-71, 2006.
  \end{itemize}
  This algorithm uses spring forces as attractive forces between vertices 
  connected by an edge and electric forces as repulsive forces between 
  all vertex pairs. Hu introduces coarsening, a procedure which repeatedly 
  merges vertices in order to obtain a smaller version of the graph, to 
  overcome local minima. He also uses the Barnes-Hut algorithm to enhance 
  the runtime of his algorithms. This algorithm is not used in this 
  implementation. This layout was implemented by using the Jedi framework.
