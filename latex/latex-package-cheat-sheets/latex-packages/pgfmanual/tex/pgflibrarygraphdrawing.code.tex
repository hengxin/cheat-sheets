% Callback for declaring a graph parameter key
%
% #1 = Parameter key
% #2 = Parameter type
%
% Description:
%
% When a graph drawing algorithm starts working, a set of options,
% called "graph drawing parameters" in the following, can influence the
% way the algorithm works. For instance, an graph drawing parameter
% might be the average distance between vertices which the algorithm
% should take into account. Another example might be the fact the
% certain nodes are special nodes and that a certain edge should have
% a large label.
%
% These graph drawing parameters are different from "usual" pgf
% options: An alogrithmic parameter influenced the way the algorithm
% works, while usual options normally only influence how the result
% looks like. For instance, the fact that a node is red is not an
% graph drawing parameter (usually, at least), while the shape of a node
% might be an graph drawing parameter.
%
% Graph drawing parameters are declared by the algorithmic layer
% (since only this layer "knows" which parameters there are). The
% binding to TeX will call the \pgfgddeclareparameter function
% internally.
% 
% Specifying the set of graph drawing parameters for a given graph or
% node or edge works as follows: When the graph drawing engine is
% started for a graph (using \pgfgdbeginscope), a snapshot is taken of
% all graph drawing parameters currently setup at this
% point. Similarly, when a node is created inside such a scope, a
% snapshot is taken of the set of all graph drawing parameters in
% force at this point is taken and stored together with the
% node. Finally, when an edge is created, a snapshot of the setting of
% the graph drawing parameters is taken.

% Graph events  
% 
% Although a graph consists of nodes and edges, during the
% construction of the graph a lot of information concerning the
% structure of the graph is often available. For instance, as we
% specify a graph using the child-syntax, we do not only which edges
% are present, but we can implicitly specify an ordering on the
% nodes. Even more, there is even information availble concerning
% nodes that are not present at all: A child[missing] is not present
% as a node or an edge, but a tree drawing algorithm will want to know
% about this child nevertheless.
% 
% In order to communicate such information to the graph drawing
% engine, "events" are used. As a graph is created, in addition to
% nodes and edges, "events" may happen. The events come in a
% sequential order and they are stored together with the graph. For
% each node and each edge, its index in the event sequence is
% stored, that is, it is stored how many events happened before the
% node or edge was created.
% 
% Internally, an event consists of a name and, possibly, some
% parameters. When the parameter is created on the tikz level, it will
% be a string that is passed down to Lua. Internally created events
% will also have parameters that are objects.
% 
% Two events are a bit special since they get special internal
% support: The begin and end events. The first signals that some kind
% of group has started; which is closed by the corresponding end
% event. The "kind" of group is indicated by the parameter of the
% begin event.
% 
% 
% 
% Standard events are:
% 
% For each node entered into a graph, a "node" event is automatically
% created internally with the parameter being the node. However, you
% can also create this event yourself. In this case, the parameter
% will be a string and will mean that the node is "virtual" or
% "missing", but space should be reserved for it, if possible (this is
% use, for instance, by certain tree layouts).
% 
% For each edge entered into a graph, an "edge" event is automatically
% created, with the edge as the parameter. Again, an event with a
% string parameter corresponds to a "non-existing" node.
% 
%
% Standard event groups are:
% 
%
% The "descendants" event group include a set of nodes that, at least
% inside the specification, are descendants of the last node
%
% begin descendants
% ...
% end
% 
% 
% The "array" event group collects together some nodes in an array of
% nodes. This can be used, for instance, to specify matrices.
% 
% begin array
% ...

% #3 = edge direction
% #4 = edge options (will be executed in a protected environment)
% #5 = aux stuff (curtesy for TikZ -- edge nodes)
%
% Description:
%
% Creating an edge means that you tell the graph drawing algorithm
% that #1 and #2 are connected. The "kind" of connection is indicated
% by #3, which may be one of the following:
% 
% ->  = a directed edge (also known as an arc) from #1 to #2
% --  = an undirected edge between #1 and #2
% <-  = a directed edge from #2 to #1, but with the "additional hint"
%       that this is a "backward" edge. A graph drawing algorithm may
%       or may not take this hint into account
% <-> = a bi-directed edge between #1 and #2.
% 
%
% The parameters #4 and #5 are a bit more tricky. When an edge between
% two vertices of a graph is created via \pgfgdedge, nothing is
% actually done immediately. After all, without knowing the final
% positions of the nodes #1 and #2, there is no way of
% creating the actual drawing commands for the edge. Thus, the actual
% drawing of the edge is done only when the graph drawing algorithm is
% done (namely in the macro \pgfgdcallbackedge, see later).
% 
% Because of this "delayed" drawing of edges, options that influence
% the edge must be retained until the moment when the edge is actually
% drawn. Parameters #4 and #5 store such options.
% 
% Let us start with #4. This parameter should be set to a list of
% key-value pairs like
% 
%   /tikz/.cd, color=red, very thick, this edge must be vertical
% 
% Some of these options may be of interest to the graph drawing
% algorithm (like the last option) while others will 
% only be important during the drawing of edge (like the first
% option). The options that are important for the graph drawing
% algorithm must be passed to the algorithm via setting keys that have
% been declared using the handler .edge parameter (see 
% above).
% 
% The tricky part is that options that are of interest to the graph
% drawing algorithm must be executed *before* the algorithm starts,
% but the options as a whole are usually only executed during the
% drawing of the edges, which is *after* the algorithm has finished.
% 
% To overcome this problem, the following happens:
% 
% The options in #4 are executed "tentatively" inside
% \pgfgdedge. However, this execution is done in a "heavily guarded
% sandbox" where all effects of the options (like changing the
% color or the line width) do not propagate beyond the sandbox. Only
% the changes of the graph drawing edge parameters leave the
% sandbox. These parameters are then passed down to the graph drawing
% engine.
% 
% Later, when the edge is drawn using \pgfgdcallbackedge, the options #4
% are available once more and then they are executed normally.
%
% Note that when the options in #4 are executed, no path is
% preset. Thus, you typically need to start it with, say, /tikz/.cd.
%
%
% The text in #5 is some "auxilliary" text that is simply stored away
% and later directly to \pgfgdcallbackedge. This is a curtesy to TikZ,
% which can use it to store its node labels. 
%
% Example:
%

% 
% Descriptions:
% 
% This is a callback from the graph drawing engine. At the end of the
% creation of a graph, when the nodes have been positioned, this macro
% is called once for each edge. The macro should take the following
% parameters:
% 
% #1 = from node, optionally followed by "." and the tail anchor
% #2 = to node, optionally followed by "." and the head anchor
% #3 = direction (<-, --, ->, or <->)
% #4 = original options
% #5 = aux text (typically edge nodes)
% #6 = algorithm-generated options
% #7 = bend information
%
% The first five parameters are the original values that were passed
% down to the \pgfgdedge command.
% 
% #6 contains options that have been "computed by the algorithm". For
% instance, an algorithm might have determined, say, flow capacities
% for edges and it might now wish to communicate this information back
% to the upper layers. These options should be executed with the path
% /graph drawing.
% 
% #7 contains algorithmically-computed information concerning how the
% edge should bend. This will be a text like
% "--(10pt,20pt)--(30pt,40pt)" in tikz-syntax, using the path
% operations "--", "..controls" and "--cycle".
%

% Creates a subgraph node
% 
% #1 = name

% 
% Description:
% 
% A subgraph node is a node that "surrounds" the nodes of a
% subgraph. The special property of a subgraph node opposed to a
% normal node is that it is created only after the subgraph has been
% laid out. However, the difference to a collection like "hyper" is
% that the node is availble immediately as a normal node in the sense
% that you can connect edges to it.
% 
% What happens internally is that subgraph nodes get "registered"
% immediately both on the pgf level and on the lua level, but the
% actual node is only created inside the layout pipeline using a
% callback. The actual node creation happens when the innermost layout
% in which the subgraph node is declared has finished.
% 
% When you create a subgraph node using this macro, you also start a
% collection (of an internal kind) that stores the subgraph. All
% following nodes in the current TeX scope will become part of this
% collection. 
% 
% See |InterfaceToDisplay.pushSubgraphVertex| for details.

% 
% Requests
% 
% Description:
% 
% This key is used to ``request'' a graph drawing scope and a
% layout. The objective of this key is to make it easier for users and
% algorithm designers to control the slightly involved
% back-and-forth-calling between the different layers.
% 
% This key does the following: When called inside a pgfpicture
% (otherwise, the call is "illegal"), it will call a call-back with
% two parameters. This callback will get passed some code that should
% be executed at the beginning of ``the next scope'' and some code
% that should be executed at the end of that scope.
% 
% The code passed to the callbacks will have a different effect,
% depending on whether we are currently inside a layout scope or not
% (if no graph drawing scope is open, we are 
% not inside a layout). If we are not inside a layout scope (or if the
% layout scope has been interrupted), the code will issue a
% \pgfgdbeginscope command in the opening code and a corresponding
% scope ending command in the closing code. Next, the two code pieces
% always contain \pgfgdbeginlayout and \pgfgdendlayout.
% 
% Note that the "@request scope and layout" key will not immediately
% trigger a layout scope to be created; rather, the TikZ callback will
% call it only at the beginning of the scope, which will be after
% other options in the current list of options have been parsed. So,
% when you write \graph [binary tree layout, significant sep=2em] ...,
% the "significant sep" option has an effect despite being given
% *after* the "@request scope and layout" key since the actual opening
% of the scope happens only before the "..." part is parsed.

% edges have to be indicated explicitly using the macro \pgfgdedge
% (this is because it is somewhat unclear what, exactly, should count
% as an edge). Naturally, users typically will not call \pgfgdedge
% explicitly, but have styles and keys invoke it internally.
%
% Usage:
% 
% \pgfgdset{algorithm=somealgorithm}
% \pgfgdbeginscope
%   \pgfnode{rectangle}{center}{A}{A}{}
%   \pgfnode{rectangle}{center}{B}{B}{}

%   \pgfgdedge{B}{C}{->}{}{}
%   \pgfgdedge{C}{A}{->}{}{}
% \pgfgdendscope

% 
% \tikz \graph [some algorithm] { A -> B -> C -> A };
